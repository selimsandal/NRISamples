# NRI Samples

[![Status](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRISamples/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRISamples/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is the test bench for [*NRI (NVIDIA Rendering Interface)*](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRI).

## Build instructions

### Windows

- Install **WindowsSDK** and **VulkanSDK**
- Clone project and init submodules
- Generate and build project using **cmake**
  - To build the binary with static MSVC runtime, add `-DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY="MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>"` parameter

Or by running scripts only:
- Run ``1-Deploy.bat``
- Run ``2-Build.bat``

### Linux

- Install **VulkanSDK**, **xorg-dev**,
- Clone project and init submodules
- Generate and build project using **cmake**

Or by running scripts only:
- Run `./1-Deploy.sh`
- RUn `./2-Build.sh`

### macOS

- Install **Xcode** 26+ and the Metal toolchain (`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`)
- Install **VulkanSDK** (provides *DXC*, required to compile shaders, and *Vulkan* through *MoltenVK*)
- Install **Metal Shader Converter** to run the samples on *Metal* (HLSL → DXIL → Metal, enabled automatically if installed, *Metal* becomes the default API; otherwise *Vulkan* is used)
- Clone project and init submodules
- Generate and build project using **cmake**

### CMake options

- `DISABLE_SHADER_COMPILATION` - disable compilation of shaders (shaders can be built on other platform)
- `NRIF_USE_WAYLAND` - use Wayland instead of X11 on Linux

## How to run

The executables from `_Bin` directory load resources from `_Data`, therefore the samples need to be run with the working directory set to the project root folder. But the simplest way to run ALL samples sequentially is to click on `3-Test samples.bat`.
